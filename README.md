There are four datasets provided to you to process, which are as follows:

- train_sent
- test_sent
- train_label
- test_label

You have the train and the test datasets; the train dataset is used to train the CRF model, and the test dataset is used to evaluate the built model.

## Conclusions

- A dictionary is created in which diseases are keys and treatments are values.
